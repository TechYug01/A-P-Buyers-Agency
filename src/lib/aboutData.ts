At A&P Buyers Agency, property isn't just about numbers on a page — it's about people.
We know what it feels like to take that first big step into the property market: the excitement, the nerves, the endless questions. We've been there ourselves. Over the years, we've built our own portfolios, navigated market highs and lows, and learned what truly works (and what doesn't).

That's why we started A&P — to make the process clearer, smarter, and less stressful for others. Whether you're buying your first home or your fifth investment, our role is to guide you with strategies that are practical, data-driven, and proven through real experience.

We don't just chase trends or push generic advice. Every recommendation is tailored to your goals, backed by research, and shaped by the lessons we've learned firsthand. Our clients trust us because we treat every purchase like it's our own — with care, clarity, and commitment from start to finish.

For more than two decades ago, I built a successful career in the IT industry. It was a rewarding journey that sharpened my skills in research, analysis, and problem-solving. But throughout those 25 years, there was always one thing that pulled at my heart more than anything else: property.

What began as a personal interest soon became a lifelong passion. I purchased my first investment over 23 years ago, and since then I've grown my portfolio, weathered multiple market cycles, and experienced firsthand the power of property to transform lives. Each boom, slowdown, and recovery taught me something new — critical lessons in patience, timing, and strategy that no textbook could ever teach.

While IT gave me a strong foundation of discipline and analytical thinking, property gave me purpose. Eventually, I knew it was time to take the leap and fully immerse myself in the world I loved most. To do that, I invested in high-level property courses and began my journey into property development. Education gave me structure, but development gave me confidence — watching a project come to life showed me exactly what's possible when passion meets planning.

Today, I am proud to be involved in more than 10 active development projects across Australia. This hands-on experience gives me unique insights into the property market, from spotting the right opportunities to managing projects from the ground up — knowledge I now share with my clients every day.

And that's when everything clicked: property isn't just about bricks and mortar. It's about freedom. It's about creating opportunities, building security for your family, and opening doors to the kind of lifestyle you've always dreamed of.

I realised I didn't want to just build wealth for myself — I wanted to help others do it too.

That's why I became a buyer's agent.
Today, I bring together more than two decades of personal investing, hands-on development experience, and professional training to guide clients through their own property journeys. Whether it's buying your first home, securing a strong investment, or growing a portfolio, my role is to make the process clear, strategic, and stress-free.

What sets me apart is simple: I've lived this journey myself. I know what it feels like to make that first big purchase and the nerves that come with it. I know the thrill of watching an investment grow in value and the challenge of staying calm when the market shifts. Because I've been there, I can walk alongside you not just as an advisor, but as a partner who understands your dreams, fears, and ambitions.

My clients often tell me they value my straightforward approach — I listen closely, explain clearly, and back every recommendation with research and experience. For me, it's not about selling an idea. It's about empowering you with the knowledge and confidence to make the right decisions.

At the end of the day, my mission is simple: to help people create wealth, security, and freedom through property.

Property has changed my life, and I believe it can change yours too. If you're ready to take the next step, I'd love to guide you on the journey. Together, we can turn your property goals into a reality worth celebrating.

Property has been my passion for more than 15 years, and in that time, I've built a diverse portfolio spanning residential homes, acreages, SMSF investments, and house-and-land packages. From hands-on renovations to developing villas and townhouses, I've learned what it takes to unlock potential and build lasting wealth.

What sets me apart is my focus on strategy. I specialise in finding high capital growth properties across Australia with minimal out of pocket costs — so my clients can invest smarter without unnecessary stress. With the support of my personal property coach, every decision is backed by thorough research and data-driven insights. The result? Confidence at every step of the journey.

I know first-hand how overwhelming it can feel to buy your first property or investment. The process can be stressful and confusing, and that's exactly why I became a buyer's agent — to make the journey easier, faster, and more rewarding for others.

I've worked with everyone from first-time buyers to investors expanding their portfolios, and my clients consistently experience me going above and beyond to secure the right property. Speed and responsiveness are my strengths, and I take pride in removing stress while protecting my clients' interests.

From the moment you sign up with me, I'm there every step of the way — coordinating everything from property search to negotiation, contracts, settlement, and even securing a rental if needed. My role is to be your advocate and guide, ensuring the entire process feels smooth and supported.

Beyond property, I'm a proud mum of two young girls, passionate about mindset, personal growth, and inspiring others to dream big. My background in IT and data analysis gives me an edge in spotting trends and opportunities, but what drives me most is people, relationships, and helping clients create a future they're excited about.

If you're ready to start or grow your property journey with someone who brings strategy, care, and dedication to every step — I'd love to connect!
