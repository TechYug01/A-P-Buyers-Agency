      We recently purchased our first home, and we're so grateful to have had Pratiksha and Anita assist us throughout the process.
      
      Pratiksha was professional, responsive, and always available to guide us with clear communication. She skilfully handled the negotiations with the agent and helped us secure a fair price, something we truly appreciated as first-time buyers.
      
      Throughout the journey, we felt genuinely supported and never pressured — just honest advice, prompt responses, and dependable follow-through from both Pratiksha and Anita.
      
      Thank you both for helping us move into our dream home with confidence!

      We had mixed experiences from other buyer agencies in the past. I was very sceptical when I got a call from Pratiksha for our journey to source properties within the stipulated time.
      
      Pratiksha has attention to detail to source properties that suit within the constraints of the clients. She coped with my interactions and my intentions of investment strategy.
      
      We are thankful for her and her team in collaborating with me cohesively to finalise the contract exchange. We look forward to making further transactions soon.

      We couldn't be happier with our new home, and we thank you for making it possible.
      
      Really helpful until settlement and highly recommend to people if anyone looking to buy property — the best person Pratiksha. Very kind and patiently she dealt with the agent to hold the property until it got approval.
